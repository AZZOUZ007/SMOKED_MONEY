# SMOKED_MONEY
A small telegram bot to track how much money smoking is taking out of your pocket.

All you need to do is add your telegram bot token in the placeholder, and you're good to go, the bot will ask for the single cigarette price, and the date you started smoking, the rest will be dynamically computed based on values for the database that the app creates for you.
