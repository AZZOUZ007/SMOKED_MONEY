# SMOKED_MONEY
A small telegram bot to track how much money smoking is taking out of your pocket.

Heavy smoking mainly comes from stress or hyperfocused work, that are almost always related to making more money, so I'm trying to access your mind the same way, the less you smoke the more money you get to keep.

All you need to do is add your telegram bot token in the placeholder, and you're good to go, the bot will ask for the single cigarette price, and the date you started smoking, the rest will be dynamically computed based on values in the database that the app creates for you.
